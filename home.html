  <!-- OUR STORY -->
  <section class="our-story">
    <div class="story-overlay">
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Fine wine has been celebrated for thousands of years, carrying with it a rich history of craftsmanship and tradition. 
        Its aging process reveals layers of flavor over time, drawing out subtle nuances shaped by the environment and the grapes from which it was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        Green Dragon’s story, however, is less straightforward—shaped by the shadows of prohibition and the snake oil era of the early 1900s. 
        My journey began with simple recipes: soaking flowers in spirits before the turn of the century. 
        Over decades, I studied and refined techniques—experimenting with RSO, purification, and the fundamentals of organic chemistry—all in pursuit of recreating that timeless feeling of friends gathered, passing a joint in easy conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This handcrafted Dragon captures the essence of cannabis in a suspension of pure bliss. 
        Beginning with your chosen ounce, we carefully pasteurize and decarboxylate, then blend it with high-proof spirits before guiding it through an extended, meticulous process that draws out the plant’s most potent natural compounds. 
        After more than 30 years of refinement, I am proud of the distinctive flavor profiles and physical effects preserved in every bottle. 
        Like a fine wine, this creation grows more complex with age—and it shines brightest when shared among friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, true to its name, the Dragon prefers a cool, dark palace. 
        Let it rest for four days after bottling; that’s when the real magic begins.
